# Upgrading

Taking newer dev-kit framework versions without losing your extensions or your configuration.

## The short version

```bash
./scripts/upgrade_dev_kit.sh --version <branch|tag|commit>   # default: main
./run.sh
```

`extensions/` and `.env` are never touched. The next `./run.sh` adopts any changed framework defaults —
new image tags — into your `.env` automatically, while keeping anything you pinned.

## What the upgrade replaces

`upgrade_dev_kit.sh` clones the dev kit from a **fixed official URL** — hardcoded in `scripts/_devkit.sh`,
never taken from your `git remote` or user input, so an adopted repo cannot redirect a framework upgrade at
an untrusted source. It then refreshes only an allowlist of framework-owned paths.

| Kind | Paths | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wholly framework-owned | `.claude/` `.github/` `nginx/` `packages/` `samples/` `scripts/` | Mirrored, including deletion of stale files **inside** those directories. |
| Shared with you | `docs/` | Framework files are overwritten and added; **nothing is deleted**, so docs you write here survive. |
| Individual files | `.env.example` `.gitignore` `docker-compose.yml` `logs.sh` `README.md` `run.sh` `stop.sh` | Overwritten in place, never deleted. |

Everything else — `extensions/`, `.env`, compose overrides, and any file you add — is preserved.

Flags:

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--version <ref>` | Branch, tag, or commit to move to. Default `main`. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip the interactive confirmation, for scripted or CI use. |

## How defaults are adopted

Framework-shipped defaults — the image tags and `STUDIO_PLATFORM` — live in
`.env.example`. An upgrade changes that file, but it never touches your `.env`. `run.sh` bridges the two on
every run.

The tracked keys are `STUDIO_TAG`, `AGENT_TAG`, `UI_TAG`, `XTERM_TAG`, and `STUDIO_PLATFORM`. Nothing
licensing-related is adopted or overwritten this way — `Licensing__Token` is yours, not a framework
default, and the license server URL is a built-in rather than a shipped `.env` value.

For each one, `run.sh` compares three values:

| Value | Source |
| --- | --- |
| the new default | `.env.example` |
| the last-applied default | `.env.defaults` — gitignored bookkeeping, rewritten every run |
| your current value | `.env` |

If your current value is empty or still equals the last-applied default, you have not diverged, so the new
default is adopted. If it differs, you pinned it — and it is kept. Adoptions are announced:

```
==> Adopted updated defaults from .env.example: STUDIO_TAG=branch-main-abc1234
```

### Pinning a tag

Pass `--studio-tag`, `--ui-tag`, or `--agent-tag`, or hand-edit `.env`. Either way the key stops tracking
`.env.example` and stays where you put it across upgrades.

### Un-pinning a tag

Delete its line from `.env` — or from `.env.defaults` — and re-run `./run.sh`. It resumes tracking the
framework default.

## Opting in to access control on existing extensions

Newer platforms authorize resources through hierarchical permission sets. Joining that model is
**opt-in per resource**: a controller with no declaration keeps its current behavior (any workspace
member can CRUD the resource, and it never appears in the permission-set editor). The samples and
the scaffold now declare their nodes, so newly-created extensions opt in by default —
`[AccessControl(Parent = typeof(Workspace), ParentIdProperty = "OwnerWorkspaceId")]` on top-level
resources, `[AccessControl(Parent = typeof(<ParentEntity>), ParentIdProperty = "Spec.ParentId")]`
on children (see `.claude/skills/duplo-extension-dev/reference/18-access-control.md`).

An upgrade never edits your code under `extensions/`, so an existing extension does **not** gain the
declaration automatically, and nothing forces it. To opt in: add the attribute (plus
`using Duplo.Ai.DataManagement.AccessControl;` / `using Duplo.Ai.Model;`), bump `manifest.version`,
rebuild, and reload.

Two things to know before reloading in a shared environment:

- The attribute compiles only against a host whose SDK ships the access-control types; on an older
  host the build fails with `CS0246: AccessControl not found` — upgrade the host first. Check what
  yours serves with `GET /v1/aiservicedesk/extensions/sdk-bundle`.
- Opting in is a behavior change for non-admin users: permission sets with a broad workspace grant
  (ALL verbs, "applies to whole subtree" — including every set migrated from the legacy model) keep
  working with no admin action, but users with narrow grants need the new node (and any named
  actions) granted before they can reach the resource again.

## Upgrading the vendored UI library

The `@duplocloud-internal/ng-common-lib` tarball that samples build against is vendored, not fetched from a
registry. Refreshing it is a separate procedure with its own constraints — see
[UPGRADING-ng-common-lib.md](UPGRADING-ng-common-lib.md).

The tarball is proprietary and is **not** covered by the Apache license on the rest of the kit. See
[TERMS.md](../TERMS.md).

## After an upgrade

1. `./run.sh` — picks up new image tags and re-runs the idempotent setup steps.
2. Rebuild and redeploy your extensions. The build compiles against the SDK published by the running
   platform, so a studio image change can mean a new SDK:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-all.sh && ./scripts/deploy-all.sh
   ```

3. If a build fails right after an upgrade, start with
   [the host-SDK entry in troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#the-extension-build-cannot-reach-the-host-sdk).
