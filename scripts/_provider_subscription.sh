# shellcheck shell=bash
# Sourced by run.sh — the `subscription` LLM provider arm: run the agent on a Claude Code
# subscription token instead of a per-token API key, so ticket work and local extension
# development bill to the same place.
#
# WHY a separate file: like the gateway arm, this one has a prompt, validation and a
# load-bearing set of blanks, which is more than the two-line inline arms carry. Expects the
# caller to define getenv/setenv, NONINTERACTIVE and the F_SUBSCRIPTION_* flag variables.
#
# Where the token comes from: `claude setup-token` on the developer's own machine (it needs a
# browser, so it cannot be done from here). That is a long-lived token intended for handing to
# a headless environment — not the short-lived access token in the OS keychain.
#
# How the agent picks this path (core/agent_setup/llm_provider.py in
# claude-code-generic-ai-agent): CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN set, and every provider above it in
# the precedence chain unset. Subscription auth sits LAST, just ahead of the Bedrock fallback,
# so that a token exported in someone's shell can never silently displace a deliberately
# configured provider. The flip side is that this arm has to clear the two keys the dev kit
# itself can set — ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL — or they would win the chain and
# the token would never be reached. Same load-bearing blanking as bedrock-instance-role's AWS
# keys and gateway's ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, and for the same reason.
#
# This is for local development. The token authenticates as one person against their own
# subscription, so it does not belong in a shared or deployed stack.

SUBSCRIPTION_DEFAULT_MODEL="claude-sonnet-5"
# Registered alongside the default so the ticket LLM picker offers both. Bare ids, same as the
# `anthropic` arm: this path is the first-party API, which is exactly what those ids name.
SUBSCRIPTION_EXTRA_MODELS="claude-opus-5"

# Strip leading/trailing whitespace from a pasted token. Normalization, NOT validation: no valid
# opaque bearer token has whitespace at its edges, so this cannot turn away a good token whatever
# shape tokens take next. Deliberately no length or stricter format check here — per the header,
# the token's shape is not a documented contract, and rejecting a valid future token with a
# confident error message would be worse than the 401 it was meant to prevent.

  That returns a long-lived token beginning sk-ant-oat01- — copy it and paste it below.
