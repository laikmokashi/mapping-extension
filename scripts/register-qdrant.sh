# Turn the dev-kit's Qdrant container into a usable Knowledge Base.
#
# WHY: docker-compose brings Qdrant up, but the studio only ever talks to it through platform records —
# and a fresh dev-kit DB has none of them. This creates the chain the backend actually resolves:
#
#   provider  local-qdrant   type=qdrant, category=vectorDatabase, accountId=<url>, credential 'qdrant'
#   scope     qdrant         over that provider, so the provider shows up in the ticket scope picker
#   workspace extension-dev  ← the scope attached, which is what makes it selectable
#   collection devkit-docs   EMPTY — you upload your own documents from the UI
#
# The provider shape is not negotiable: QdrantConnectionResolver.FromProvider reads the URL from
# `accountId` and the key from a credential DataEx entry keyed `apiKey` (case-insensitive), and throws if
# either is missing. GetByTypeAsync("qdrant") is an exact, case-sensitive match on `type`, so the type
# string must be lowercase 'qdrant' or the KB worker will never find the provider.
#
# NOTE (this surprises people): the collection's OWN read access is not the 'qdrant' scope below. The KB
# reconcile worker mints a read-only, collection-scoped Qdrant token, stores it as a second credential on
# the same provider, wraps it in a scope named kb-devkit-docs-readonly, and attaches THAT to the
# collection's ownerWorkspaceId — all by itself, ~60s after create. That is why we pass ownerWorkspaceId
# and never create the read scope here. The 'qdrant' scope is the plain provider scope, a separate thing.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/register-qdrant.sh [workspace-id]
#   workspace-id defaults to EXTENSION_DEV_WORKSPACE_ID in .env; without one the scope is left unattached
#   and the collection is created admin-managed (no owner workspace).
#   QDRANT_INTERNAL_URL (env, optional) overrides the Qdrant URL. It must be the compose-network name
#   (http://qdrant:6333) — the studio container resolves it, and localhost there is the studio itself.
#   QDRANT_API_KEY (.env) is the master key, matching QDRANT__SERVICE__API_KEY in docker-compose.yml.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = provider, scope and collection all in place. 3 = partial — the provider and scope were
#   created, the collection was skipped because the studio has not seeded an embedding model yet; re-run.
#   1 = failed. run.sh distinguishes all three in its summary banner, so keep 3 meaning exactly this.
#
# Ingestion, separately, needs AWS Bedrock: the seeded embedding model is Bedrock/Cohere and the agent
# rejects every other provider, so on the direct-Anthropic path the collection still reaches Ready but
# document uploads fail. Creating it anyway is deliberate — one code path, and the Knowledge Base is there
# to inspect either way.
