# Register a starter 'devops' skill + persona with the studio and attach the persona to a workspace.
#
# WHY: a fresh dev-kit DB has built-in skills but no persona, and a workspace with no persona gives the
# agent no role to play. This creates one end-to-end example of the chain — Skill → Persona → Workspace —
# that you then edit in the UI (AI Admin → Skills / Personas) rather than build from scratch.
#
# Idempotent by NAME, like register-agent.sh: an existing skill or persona is adopted, never rewritten,
# so your edits to the placeholder SKILL.md survive every subsequent ./run.sh.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/register-persona.sh [workspace-id]

# DevOps

This is a starter skill created by the dev kit so the Skill -> Persona -> Workspace chain is wired up
end to end. It does nothing useful yet — edit it under AI Admin -> Skills.

## Core principle

Say, in a sentence or two, how the task this skill covers actually works.

## Steps

1. Replace these steps with the real procedure.
2. Be specific: name the commands, APIs and files the agent should use.

## Best practices

- Spell out the trigger conditions in the description above — that is how the agent decides when to
  apply this skill at all.
